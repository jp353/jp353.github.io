I’m a data analyst with a background in Management Information Systems, graudating Summa Cum Laude from West Virginia University. I thrive at the intersection of business strategy and technical execution; I'm passionate about building solutions that improve processes, uncover insights, and support smarter decisions for businesses.

I’ve managed and contributed to various techincal projects across finance, real estate, and academic domains, using tools like Power BI, SQL, and Python. I'm now seeking a full-time role where I can use data to solve complex problems and contribute to organizational growth.
